      I am Muhammad Ilham, a fresh graduate of Batam State Polytechnic, majoring in Informatics Engineering. The rapid development in the world of technology has attracted the interest of many people, including myself. I am interested in pursuing programming, currently my skills are quite proficient in the field of frontend developers, using html, css and javascript. Currently I am learning to use the library from javascript, namely react.js using the vite js framework as its fundamental. With a little ability in the backend field, it is easy for me to learn about website creation. I am also interested in becoming a fullstack developer, where previously, I had become a fullstack developer during my internship. The framework I use is the .Net framework with a SQL Server database. I also design my own database for the needs of the application I created during my internship. However, I also have an interest in the field of data analysis. Where data analysis is needed by many companies in the world. The broad job prospects give me an interest in the field of data analysis
